# Carbon Reduction Potential of Electric Ride-hailing Scheduling in Intelligent Photovoltaic Microgrids

## Overview

This repository contains the research and implementation of a novel framework for optimizing electric ride-hailing services in coordination with photovoltaic energy systems. The work addresses critical challenges in renewable energy integration, specifically targeting the "duck curve" phenomenon and exploring how intelligent scheduling of electric vehicles can enhance grid stability while maximizing renewable energy utilization.

## Key Contributions

- Development of a simulation-optimization framework for dynamic ride-hailing and charging-coupled dispatch within PV energy scenarios
- Investigation of electric ride-hailing vehicles' potential in reducing carbon emissions and balancing grid load
- Integration of green energy into the electric vehicle charging dispatching framework
- Creation of a model that considers the interests of multiple stakeholders (ride-hailing platforms, grid operators, consumers)
- Analysis of performance under varying regional demands, time periods, and weather conditions

## Methodology

Our approach combines:
- Dynamic vehicle charging and ride-hailing dispatching optimization
- Regional demand modeling and supply-demand balance considerations
- Integration of photovoltaic generation patterns and grid load profiles
- Multi-stakeholder benefit analysis
- Performance evaluation using key indicators including PV utilization, peak shaving benefits, and carbon emission reductions

## Key Findings

The implementation of our proposed framework demonstrates:
- Increased photovoltaic utilization by 32.8%
- Enhanced total platform benefits by 6.62%
- Peak-shaving and valley-filling benefit of 8.82% on sunny days
- Significant potential for carbon emission reduction through coordinated EV scheduling

These results validate the potential of intelligent electric ride-hailing scheduling in supporting grid stability and renewable energy integration.
